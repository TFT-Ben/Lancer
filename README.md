# Lancer
Archived code from an old glideback high altitude balloon project called Lancer

The designs for an initial HAB avionics board were developed into a business proposal for providing a research platform to academic orgnisations and the aerospace sector.  The project got buried in potential legislation problems associated with testing an autonomous UAV miles outside of line of sight.

I've posted the original avionics board CAM files, some in progress files from a revision 2 board (was in the process of transferring to KiCAD and never finished) as well as the original avionics code, plus a full design report of the first revision and a pitch presentation given to ESA BIC and others in the space industry.
